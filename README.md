# JD's Crafty Companion App

This companion app for the Storz & Bickel Crafty+ portable vape is a personal project I undertook for a few reasons:
- I wanted to learn about SwiftUI
- I wanted to learn about Combine and MVVM in general
- Apple banned all vaping related apps from the app store (sigh..) and I wanted one for my personal use.

TODO: 
- Add the ability to set various device properties (target temp, booster temp, various settings). So far I have only added the ability to read the values over bluetooth.
- Some UI/UX polish.
